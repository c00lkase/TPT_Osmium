# Osmium Element
Osmium is a strong gray-blue metal, element 76 on the Periodic Table.
Osmium is also shiny, here's what it looks like in fancy mode:

## Reactions
Osmium reacts with OXYG to form Osmium Tetroxide, a colorless toxic gas *(kills stickmen)*. You can make this with OXYG in bulk **if** you first heat it to 400°C. *(752°F)*

Osmium Tetroxide can also be made from WATR, and it's made better this way.

The final reaction with osmium happens with ISOZ, and it forms POLO from it. This reaction is a bit violent, as it flings the solution.

## Other Properties

Osmium also is relatively strong, if you dont touch it with it's reactants it will only break when heated to 3,033°C *(5,491°F)*. It's strength also causes it to block any pressure.

Osmium is a very good conductor, like GOLD. This in combination with it's strength could help it serve as a destructible alternative to INST, and could help any production of destructible electronics.

# Osmium Tetroxide Element
Osmium Tetroxide doesn't react with any element, it's only reaction is when it undergoes nuclear fission when it's temperature is above 9000°C and the pressure is above 200.
